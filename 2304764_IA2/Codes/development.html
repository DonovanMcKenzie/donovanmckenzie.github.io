<ol style= "position:absolute; top: 140px; left:270px;" type="A">
      <li style="color: #377d22;">Humans are deeply social animals. Hardwired for connection, societies are built upon peoples relationships, Thus the adage "no man is an island" couldn't be more true.

Strong relationships, whether they're personal or professional, can make a huge difference in our lives. They provide a sense of belonging, offer support when we need it, and can even help us achieve our goals.

Friendships and family are like our personal cheerleaders. They're there to celebrate our wins and pick us up when we fall. They're a source of comfort, laughter, and shared experiences.

In the professional scene, strong relationships with colleagues, mentors, and clients can open doors to new opportunities, provide valuable advice, and even boost our confidence.

Going forward, I'll be doubling down my efforts to forge and maintain healthy relationships</li>

      <li style="color: #377d22;"> Creating a roadmap an ideal life requires one to set goals. Having a plan and acting on it is crucial to achieve long term success.

This can be done by remembering an acronymn drilled into many students' heads at the beginning of each semester; SMART. Making our goals specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. By ensuring we have a very clear idea of what you want, while being able to monitor progress, setting realistic and meaningful goals with a definitive and feasilble deadline.
While life's fortunes will ebb and flow, persistence and focus will always allow for progress, as long as we can learn from our setbacks and celebrate every bit of progress (within reason of course).</li>
</br>
        
      <li style="color: #377d22;"> Time management is crucial for personal and professional success, enhancing productivity, reducing stress, and achieving goals. 

Breaking down large projects into manageable tasks and setting multiple deadlines helps maintain a steady pace, rather than leaving everything until the final hours before a project or presentation is due. 

Prioritizing tasks and minimizing time-wasting activities are essential aspects of effective time management. By implementing these strategies, we can optimize their time, reduce stress, and achieve their goals more efficiently. </li>
</br>
	<li style="color: #377d22;">Surrounding oneself with successful individuals can provide valuable insights and inspiration, as the adage goes, birds of a feather flock together. . These individuals embody qualities and behaviors that inspire and motivate us. By cultivating a positive mindset and surrounding ourselves with like-minded individuals, we can attract like-minded individuals who contribute to our growth and success. Therefore, surrounding ourselves with positive and successful individuals is crucial for personal and professional development. These positive influences will also enable you tom further yourself, either through encouragement or direct healthy competition. this links back to something I'm sure many of our parents have said to us, show me your friends and I will show you who you are.</li>
